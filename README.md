**A MOVIE SEARCH ENGINE POWERED BY theMovieDB api**

Search for movies in their database with image previews of their posters. Layout inspired by one of my favorite movies "Leviathan" directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev (2014). 

**Responsivity issues** 
-Missing fonts and positioning

**Scripting Issues**
Throughout the search the results accumulate commas which can be seen between movie posters.
